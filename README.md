# Data Analysis with R
In this repo, I will put some stuff I play with. Also I will add some usuful tutorials that anyone can use to model, plot and analyze any kind of data, So **Enjoy** it and let me know if there are something that needs to be corrected or enhanced!


Below is the list of models and projects that will be shared in the repo:



#### 1-Descriptive Stats and Visuals 
In this part, I will assemble the main functions and methods used to generate summary statistics.
I will also try to join these summary statistics functions with all the visual graphs that make exploring any data set easy and fun.

#### 2-Linear Regression
In this part, I will work on exploring the Linear regression model.
Since it is the first regression model that anyone is going to come across, I will try to make as much comments and detailed explainations as possible to guide the user through it step by step.

#### 3-Logistic Regression
In this part, I will explain the logistic regression model and just like I did with the Linear regresison, I will walk the user through all its steps.
#### 3-Polynomial Regression
In this part, I will explore the polynomial regression and details how this model is built.
#### 4-LASSO Regression
In this part, I will work on the LASSO regression with a specific data set.
